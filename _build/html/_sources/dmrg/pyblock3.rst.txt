==============================================

**Package:** https://github.com/block-hczhai/pyblock3-preview

**Documentation:** https://pyblock3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

pyBlock3 is an MPS/PEPS/DMRG library utilizing an efficient block-sparse tensor data structure. The main features are:

1. Manipulation of block-sparse tensor using API very similar to numpy ndarray.

2. Support for custom quantum number labels.

3. Core functions are implemented in both python (slow) and C++ (optimized) version.
